# PathFindingAI
Thank you for checking out my Path-Finding AI

This is a path finding AI that uses a genetic algorithm to solve mazes given to it using a string of numbers in a text document. 
This was built using C++.

Download: [Path Finding AI](https://github.com/TorinSaville/PathFindingAI/releases)

Note: When using the program it will ask for a maze file to be inputted. This is a text document with a string of numbers. 
The first two numbers represent the width and height of the maze followed by what each square of the maze equals. 
0 = Open Space / 1 = Boundry / 2 = Start Location / 3 = End Location. These are listed left to right, top to bottom.

2 Example Mazes are Included with Download.
